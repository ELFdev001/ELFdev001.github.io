I am currently Data Manager for the ERC-funded [Subnordica](http://subnordica.eu/) project. This involves creating data infrastructure at the University of Bradford to enable data to be stored, shared and used effectively. I sit between the project's researchers, hosted in the UK, Denmark, Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands, and the university's IT and library infrastructure. This has involved setting up a metadata catalogue, an institutional DOI minting facility, and ArcGIS Enterprise server and external access to Bradford's research storage system. Although this has been done to support Subnordica, it has created processes which benefit the whole institution. Obviously, this has only been possible with the work of Bradford's It Research team and the library's cataloguing staff.
