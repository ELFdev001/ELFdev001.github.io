title:  "Some outputs"
---

2024 was a year of outputs, with two pieces of software and a book being released. All are free to access and all will be the focus of further work to a greater or lesser extent during 2025.

[Modelling the Logistics of Mantzikert](https://www.archaeopress.com/Archaeopress/Products/9781803277998) is in some sense the culmination of 17 years work, in that it leads directly from my PhD which started in 2007. In 2025 the software will be properly documented and released, though it is very user-unfriendly. The software is being altered to allow it to be used to investigate other campaigns, but it was never written to be accessible and its limitations in this regard prompted me to make future software projects much easier to alter and use.

[The 'Exhibition' edition of the Unpath'd Waters simulation](https://zwack.itch.io/unpath-exhibition) is designed to be used in public exhibitions with an ordinary PC and an X-Box controller. It travelled the UK in 2024 as part of the Unpath'd Waters Exhibition and proved to be easy to use, robust and was particularly well received when combined with a collection of physical artefacts dredged up from Doggerland. In 2025 I will produce an updated version, along with documentation and teaching materials to make it easier to use in an educational setting.

[The 'Home' edition of the Unpath'd Waters simulation](https://zwack.itch.io/unpathd-home) is designed to be a more complex simulation that can be used in a home environment, where the user has more time to interact with the processes contained in the simulation. This version will see ongoing development as part of the Subnordica project, which is due to run until 2030.
