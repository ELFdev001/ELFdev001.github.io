title:  "Forthcoming Work"

There are two bits of software and a publication coming up over the next month or so. First, the software developed for the Unpath'd Waters exhibition will be made available in executable form on Itch.io. Secondly, the software developed for the Medieval Warfare on the Grid project will also be made available as source code. Finally, the monograph of the Medieval Warfare on the Grid project will be published by Archaeopress as a free download.

I'll publish details of these separately as they become available.
