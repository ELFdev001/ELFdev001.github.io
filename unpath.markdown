# Unpath'd Waters, Undream'd Shores
[Unpath'd Waters](https://historicengland.org.uk/research/current/discover-and-understand/coastal-and-marine/unpathd-waters/) was an AHRC-funded 'Towards a National Collection' project. It was a pilot project, aimed at trialling methods of connecting maritime heritage data sets. As part of this, I worked on creating a simulation of pre-inundation Doggerland. There is a version for use in the Unpath'd Waters roaming exhibition, with a further version which can be downloaded and used at home.

Both of these versions are available on my [itch.io](https://zwack.itch.io/) page.
