# Unpath'd Waters, Undream'd Shores
[Unpath'd Waters](https://unpathdwaters.org.uk/) is an AHRC-funded 'Towards a National Collection' project. It aims to trial methods of connecting maritime heritage data sets. As part of this, I am working on creating a simulation of pre-inundation Doggerland. There is a version for use in the Unpath'd Waters roaming exhibition, with a further version which can be downloaded and used at home.

Both of these versions will be available on my [itch.io](https://zwack.itch.io/) page.
