# Philip Murgatroyd
After a few years knocking about the computer industry in various roles, I ended up in archaeology. Since then I've studied at the Universities of Bradford, York and Birmingham and worked at both Birmingham and Bradford. I've worked on the Anglo-American Project in Pompeii, MWGrid, GG-TOP, Europe's Lost Frontiers and Unpath'd Waters. I'm currently Data Manager on the ERC-funded Subnordica project.

My work mainly focusses on computer simulation in archaeology although I've also done 3D modelling and Augmented Reality stuff. I believe simulation has the capacity to transform who does archaeology, how it is done and how its results are understood and used.
