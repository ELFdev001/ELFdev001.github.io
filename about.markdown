# Philip Murgatroyd
After a few years knocking about the computer industry in various roles, I ended up in archaeology. Since then I've studied at the Universities of Bradford, York and Birmingham and worked at both Birmingham and Bradford. I've worked on the Anglo-American Project in Pompeii, MWGrid, GG-TOP, Europe's Lost Frontiers and UNPATH.

My work mainly focusses on computer simulation in archaeology although I've also done 3D modelling and Augmented Reality stuff. My current work with the UNPATH (2021-2024) project is trying to demonstrate the value of simulations which are accessible and easy to use.
